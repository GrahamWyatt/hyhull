h2. Installation/Setup

h3. Installation Prerequisites

<pre>
git checkout git@github.com:uohull/hyhull.git
</pre>

Change the current directory to "hyhull"

Install hydra-jetty. Note, jetty has been added to hyhull as a git submodule (this may take several minutes):
<pre>git submodule init
git submodule update
</pre>

Install the dependencies by running:
<pre>bundle install
</pre>

*The database*

Migrate the database
<pre>rake db:migrate</pre>

Seed the database with the pre-defined Repo roles (contentAccessTeam, staff, student etc..).

*Note*: At the end of _db/seeds.rb_ there is sample code to add users to the 'People' table and roles to the 'Roles' tables.  This is important if there is need to walk through sample logins in development mode.
To seed the data...       
<pre>rake db:seed</pre>

*Jetty*

Configure jetty:
<pre>rake hydra:jetty:config
</pre>

hyhull includes full text indexing.  The necessary solr libraries are not included with Jetty as default, copy to solr using:
<pre>rake hyhull:config:solr_text_extraction</pre>

Then start jetty:
<pre>rake jetty:start
</pre>

Load some sample data:
<pre>rake hyhull:default_fixtures:refresh
</pre>

Start the webserver
<pre>rails s
</pre>

You should now be able to see the application at: http://localhost:3000/

h3. Testing

The quickest way to test is to run this task
<pre>rake hyhull:test
</pre>

If you prefer a more manual approach, start by loading fixtures:

Migrate and seed the database
<pre>RAILS_ENV=test rake db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=test rake db:seed
</pre>

Then you can run specs:
<pre>rake spec
</pre>

And cucumber features:
<pre>rake cucumber:ok
</pre>
